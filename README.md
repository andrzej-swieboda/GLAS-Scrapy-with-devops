# ScrapyGLAS

Welcome to the GLAS-Scrapy-with-devops project!

Goal of this project is to create production and development workflows for webscraping developers, who want to write, test and deploy spiders in remote environments effortlessly and in relatively high pace.
 
Project takes use of [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy) - a fast high-level [web crawling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler) and [web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) framework, used to crawl websites and extract structured data from their pages.
